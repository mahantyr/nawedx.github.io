		<h3>June 1, 2018 to June 14, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I completed the freight-register-automation project and finally deployed that in the ACM's office. I was stuck with a problem for long time.
			Finally the solution clicked and implemented it. It works as it is supposed to. Overall the day was very productive. I think more than one eyes on the code is
			absolutely necessary for productivity. Extra pair of eyes always helps in software development. As the Linus's law states "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".
			I won't like to get into validity of this law. It just sits well in open source development.
		</p>
		<h3>June 1, 2018 to June 14, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I spent most of time reading up books on linux kernel development, linux device driver and operating systems (for reference to some topics).
			Also spent some time reading the documentation of linux kernel. I am feeling that steep learning curve I am currently in. Kernel development and Device Driver require
			knowledge of interrupt handling like spinlocks and mutex. I didn't do much of programming. Its difficult to get into code right way in kernel development as it requires
			knowledge of OS. I go through the code of the linux kernel, trying to get a hang of the code. I don't exactly understand the code but I can make out its use.
			Eager to make some real code contribution to the linux kernel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile I also wanted to explore the Redox-OS. It is in its early stages of development and is a fast moving project. I want to contribute to this project. But,
			I am not able to build the Redox toolchain (necessary for building Redox-OS) on my Fedora. I have to somehow fix this and get on speed with Redox-OS development.
			I have to add some more functionality to my freight-register-automation (browser automation) project and put it to use in ACM's office.
		</p>
		<p>
			During this time I read two books :
			<ul>
				<li>Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond</li>
				<li>The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I was searching for some books on biography of Linus Torvalds. Just for Fun is the perfect book to learn about Linus' life and how he built Linux. He also presents his views about open source software
			which I think is Gold standard.
		</p>
		<p>
			I attended Google I/O extended 2018 organised by GDG Bhubaneswar. This time they had an idea pitching session post lunch which was real fun. All the developers divided
			themselves into group of 4 and presented their starup idea to the panel. Made some friends there. Domino's Pizza for lunch and got a Google I/O Extended T-Shirt. This year's
			I/O Extended was fun.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well no computer games in my free time. I don't feel like playing computer games.
			Well, most evening I spent hanging out with school friends and playing Uno or Rummy.
