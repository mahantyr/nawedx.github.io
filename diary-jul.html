			Finished the speedtest project after continuous run of 22 hours. Generated the graphs and put the project on github.
			Link is <a href="https://github.com/nawedx/automated-speedtest">here</a>.
			Tweeted and mailed the results to Jio Care. I hope they address this issue. It was a satisfying project.
			The experience I gained from doing the freight-automation-project, helped me to quickly write the automation script for speedtest.
			I got the script up and running in 90 minutes. I had to tweak the script in order to make it resilient to network issues like latency test error, download/upload test error.
			I also implemented recovery from timeout exception. It was one of the new things I learnt in selenium.
			The real challenge for me was to plot the graph as I was not so familiar with matplotlib time series plot.
			Finally I got the graph and the whole process to get to that point was enjoyable. <br>
			The real deal with browser automation projects is the network issues. One has to write most of the code to deal with recovering from network issues.
			It is unquestionable that the network is unreliable. So, the challenge for the programmer is to make the code resilient to network jitters.

			I was pissed off by ultra slow 4G speed of Jio in the evening everyday. Also it has low speed at other times of day.
			The only time it is working good is late night. I thought of tracking the speed through out the day and find its behaviour.
			So, I wrote this python script to check speed from speedtest.net at 5 minutes intervals and store it in a excel file.
			I also wrote a script to plot the download speed and upload speed against time using matplotlib. In the evening the
			network speed was so bad that the speedtest was failing due to ultra slow connection speed.

			Worked on an automated report generation script for ACM's office KUR. Binge watched 13 Reasons Why S1. Got some real deep stuff into my system.
			Things were too heavy to process.
		</p>
		<h3>July 14, 2018 and July 15, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Lots of rain and Rick and Morty (S2 and S3).

		<h3>July 8, 2018 to July 13, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Trip to Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad with my friends. Laid back Bheemli beach. Gachibowli is love. Mindblasting Wonderla.
			Lipsmacking Biryani. Nizam's swag. Irani Chai + Osmania biscuit. Bonda with spicy coconut chutney.
