	<h3>May 13, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Read the book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson. It is an off beat self help book. I found an instant connect with the book.
		Currently building X.org. Getting very low speed like 15 KiB/s.
	</p>
	<h3>May 12, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Spent some time evaluating my goals and reconnecting to my mission.
		I went on a ride with my friends and it was a refreshing experience and helped me clear my head.
	</p>
	<h3>May 5, 2018 to May 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		I didn't do anything productive or worthwhile. Spent very less time coding. I started learning Rust.
		I started building X.org finally. Also started building Redox-OS. <br>
		X.org and Redox-OS require two different versions of Autoconf for build. So, I will install another debian based distro for Redox-OS and continue to build
		X.org on Fedora. I am unable to install Redox toolchain in Fedora and I am not able to find proper support to
		solve this issue. Hence, its better to Dual Boot a Debian based distro for Redox-OS development. <br>
		I will be spending my summer contributing to Redox-OS, X.org and mostly learn to build systems software.
		I am fascinated by Redox-OS. I want to build a file-system from scratch and found that Redox-OS has its own file-system.
		<a href="http://ticki.github.io/">Ticki</a> has developed the TFS (based on ZFS). I am inspired by the work done by <a href="https://github.com/jackpot51/">Zeremy Soller</a> the creator of Redox-OS.
		I also want to learn about Distributed systems. But, I think I will take it up after a few months.
		<br><br>
		Apart from these, I generally spent my evening with my friends and go on rides. I am currently watching Breaking Bad (Currenly in season 4).
		I enjoyed playing GTA Vice City without cheat codes and it was very satisfying.
	</p>
	<h3>May 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Watched Infinity War at Keshari in the morning. In the evening, dropped Raj at his house and came back home.
		End of 4th Semester and beginning of summer vacation.
	</p>
	<h3>May 3, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Messed up the Theory of Computation exam. Very poor performance. Anyway the exams are finished. In the evening
		went out to Dhauli with Raj and Niteen to watch the a show on history of Dhauli and Ashoka. The show was projected right on to
		the monument and narrated in Hindi by Om Puri. Had an awesome dinner.
	</p>
	<h3>May 2, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Prepared for Theory of Computation exam.
	</p>
	<h3>May 1, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		It was Organisational Behaviour exam and my performance was good.
	</p>
