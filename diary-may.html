		<h3>May 28, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Finally successfully built and booted the vanilla kernel (latest stable kernel of linux). It is easy to do. The trick is in the kernel config. When I used the default
			config to build the kernel I was not able to boot using that. Then, I made some changes using menuconfig for EFI booting but didn't work. Then, I used the distribution
			kernel's config file. Though it took a lot of time to build but it worked. I was able to boot through that kernel.
		</p>
		<h3>May 23, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Spent the whole day working on browser automation project. I was able to initialize the Firefox profile using selenium by passing a custom profile. Customised the
			preferences so that the dialog doesn't come up. Learnt to use AutoIt. Made some scripts to assist Selenium in automation outside of browser. But, still there is much work
			left to be done. Shitty internet connection (Jio 4G) was my time killer. I even don't have any decent broadband provider in my area. Maybe I will try some other network provider.
		</p>
		<h3>May 22, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Continued with linux device driver from where I left. Finished its chapter 2 and moved on to Char Drivers (Chapter 3). I haven't yet built a vanilla kernel.
			I was using the Fedora's distribution kernel. I found this book Linux in a Nutshell by Greg Kroah-Hartman which has explained about building the kernel and all. I will try building and
			running a vanilla kernel from kernel.org.
		</p>
		<h3>May 21, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Last night my dreams were Sherlocked. I was solving crimes in my dream with Sherlock. Watched Greg Kroah-Hartman's tech talk at Google back in 2008.
			Did some random browsing on kernel development and read some articles about them. Watched some more videos of kernel developers. It was inspiring.
		</p>
		<h3>May 20, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Spent the day binge watching Sherlock. Went out to meet friends in the evening.
		</p>
		<h3>May 19, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Didn't do much and spent time browsing youtube.
		</p>
		<h3>May 18, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Spent the day working on my freight automation project. I am unable to find any workable solution to silently printing a page without any dialog.
			I was trying to do that on Firefox using selenium. Then, I also tried Chrome. It has kiosk-printing mode but I was unable to start Chrome though Selenium with kiosk-printing mode.
			It only opened with kiosk-printing mode when I opened it though its desktop shortcut. Moreover I am implementing this automation in Win7. It doesn't have any printer that can Print to PDF.
			So, I used Foxit PDF printer to do the same. Win10 has this Print to PDF printer by installed.
		</p>
		<h3>May 17, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I did some more research. I updated my kernel using dnf update kernel command. Installed the kernel-devel package
			for my distribution kernel. Then compiled the hello kernel module. It worked and then ran insmod ./hello-kernel.ko as root.
			It gave error message that permission denied. I researched more and found that to load module using insmod the secure boot has to be turned off.
			Did that in BIOS menu and then the module successfully loaded using insmod. Then, I tried to find the kernel log at /var/log/messages.
			The 'messages' file was not their and then I read the README in /var/log to find that journalctl keeps all the log files.
			I checked the journalctl and found the "Hello, World!" message when the module was loaded. Delighted to write my first kernel module.
			And I know it only gets tougher from here. I am ready.
		</p>
		<h3>May 16, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I tried to install older version of GCC that was compatible with kernel 2.6.x but alas got more errors. It is always like
			some module is missing. I finally thought of downloading the latest kernel and compiling it. I downloaded the kernel,
			extracted it, generated defconfig for make and then executed make. Everything happened without error. Then, updated the grub and rebooted.
			I was unable to boot using the newly loaded kernel and had to boot using Fedora's distribution kernel.
		</p>
		<h3>May 15, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I started writing a simple hello kernel module. I wrote the hello kernel program in C and wrote the Makefile.
			Everything is given in the book as well as many online resources and blogs have similar hello kernel program.
			It was easy to write the program and makefile but it didn't execute. The book is using linux kernel 2.6.x.
			It is way older version than today's kernel that runs 4.16.x. I tried to compile the older kernel multiple time but failed due
			different version of GCC.
		</p>
		<h3>May 14, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I thought I should explore linux kernel development and device driver development first before diving into X.org.
			So, I started reading "Linux Device Driver" by Alessandro Rubini. This book also has information on linux kernel development.
		</p>
	<h3>May 13, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Read the book "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson. It is an off beat self help book. I found an instant connect with the book.
		Currently building X.org. Getting very low speed like 15 KiB/s.
	</p>
	<h3>May 12, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Spent some time evaluating my goals and reconnecting to my mission.
		I went on a ride with my friends and it was a refreshing experience and helped me clear my head.
	</p>
	<h3>May 5, 2018 to May 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		I didn't do anything productive or worthwhile. Spent very less time coding. I started learning Rust.
		I started building X.org finally. Also started building Redox-OS. <br>
		X.org and Redox-OS require two different versions of Autoconf for build. So, I will install another debian based distro for Redox-OS and continue to build
		X.org on Fedora. I am unable to install Redox toolchain in Fedora and I am not able to find proper support to
		solve this issue. Hence, its better to Dual Boot a Debian based distro for Redox-OS development. <br>
		I will be spending my summer contributing to Redox-OS, X.org and mostly learn to build systems software.
		I am fascinated by Redox-OS. I want to build a file-system from scratch and found that Redox-OS has its own file-system.
		<a href="http://ticki.github.io/">Ticki</a> has developed the TFS (based on ZFS). I am inspired by the work done by <a href="https://github.com/jackpot51/">Zeremy Soller</a> the creator of Redox-OS.
		I also want to learn about Distributed systems. But, I think I will take it up after a few months.
		<br><br>
		Apart from these, I generally spent my evening with my friends and go on rides. I am currently watching Breaking Bad (Currenly in season 4).
		I enjoyed playing GTA Vice City without cheat codes and it was very satisfying.
	</p>
	<h3>May 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Watched Infinity War at Keshari in the morning. In the evening, dropped Raj at his house and came back home.
		End of 4th Semester and beginning of summer vacation.
	</p>
	<h3>May 3, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Messed up the Theory of Computation exam. Very poor performance. Anyway the exams are finished. In the evening
		went out to Dhauli with Raj and Niteen to watch the a show on history of Dhauli and Ashoka. The show was projected right on to
		the monument and narrated in Hindi by Om Puri. Had an awesome dinner.
	</p>
	<h3>May 2, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Prepared for Theory of Computation exam.
	</p>
	<h3>May 1, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		It was Organisational Behaviour exam and my performance was good.
	</p>
