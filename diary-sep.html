			Back to file system design after a long period of gap. This time with more determination to build a modern
			file system from scratch. Don't know how much time it will take to implement this project. 
		</p>
		<h3>Sep 10, 2018 and Sep 11, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Binge watched "All or Nothing" on Amazon Prime. Absolutely amaing documentary on Manchester City FC.
			The narration is amazing, provides lot on inside footage, emotions of players, staff and the fans.
			Awesome documentary. Cheers to its makers. Thank you Manchester City for this documentary.
			Take a bow Pep.

		<h3>Sep 7, 2018 to Sep 9, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Conducted 3 days Introduction to Python Session. First two days Ravi Teja taught people about the basics of
			Python. On third day I taught them how to use API and build CLI tools in Python. Then, they built
			a CLI tool using "open weather map" API to display the current weather condition of the city specified in command line.

			It was a very productive day. Some class cancelled, some bunked and in some, I was not allowed inside for being late.
			There are some good faculty but some are very bad.
			Doing my project is far better utilisation of the time than attending the class. So, I am bunking
			a lot of classes this semester or just doing my thing in the back bench.<br><br>

			The Lab instructors focuses more on making people do something out fear than motivating people to try and learn something.
			There are innovative ways to make people teach Computer Organization, Compiler Design and DBMS. Rather, the
			instructors are using ancient techniques to do the Labs. There is always a better way to impart education.
			The way some people teach courses in IIIT-Bh is total shit. IIIT-Bh takes course feedback from students
			every semester but what is the use. The courses are not improving.<br><br>

			The only thing that I like in IIIT-Bh is the student community. The student driven activites are awesome.
			They are done passionately by students for development of students. The only thing that keeps people sane
			here is the student run clubs.

		<h3>Sep 3, 2018 to Sep 5, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Attending classes for attendance. Working through the "APUE" book.
		</p>
		<h3>Sep 2, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			It was Linux Fest 2018. This event involved telling the 1st years about Linux based operating system and
			helping them install Ubuntu 16.04. After that some hands on training with linux shell commands. We solved a lot
			of problems during installation. Different problems for different hardwares.
		</p>
		<h3>Sep 1, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Housekeeping work in the morning. Went out to city with roomie. Had some awesome food and bike ride in rain.
