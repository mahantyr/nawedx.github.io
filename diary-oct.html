		<h3>Oct 25, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Tweaked the browser automation script according to the changes in the FOIS website to download 2 files
			automatically from the website. Refactored python codes in the freight-register project, added gitignore
			as things were getting cluttered. Watched PJ play Far Cry 3. The game is awesome. Found out that Steam
			made CS:GO free for offline play. So, downloaded Steam and CS:GO on my linux machine. Not getting more than 20 fps.
			I think I have to fix some graphics issues.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 24, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Wrote a script to merge two excel files and extract some information from the merged data for ACM's Office.
			Drove back to hostel in the evening, cleaned room and caught up with friends.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 23, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Started learning about the JavaFX for making the Indian Rummy multiplayer game for Java Lab Project.
			I need to learn JavaFX for building the game UI and Networking in Java for making it multiplayer. Initially, I
			thought to build Tic-Tac-Toe game but that is already present in out Java textbook.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 22, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Wrote a python script that will download an xls file from FOIS website and extract a few information from
			the file and generate a message. Then I used SMTP library of python to send the message to the specified
			email addresses. A new thing I learnt today was the SMTP library. I found it difficult to set up Gmail SMTP.
			So, I used outlook instead which has hassle-free set up for SMTP.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 21, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Went to watch movie 'Badhai Ho 'with friends. Had lunch with friends at SMOG Resto Cafe. This
			restaurant has awesome ambience and great food.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 19, 2018 and Oct 20, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Some random home stuff. Family time. Working through TRPL book. Some episodes of House M.D S-1.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 18, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			I went on a Road Trip with my school gang. We started early at 5:00. My vehicle had some trouble on the way
			but automatically got fixed when we stopped for breakfast. Went to Chandrabhaga, then Ramchandi and finally
			Puri. It was nice to catch up with school friends and had a blast with them. One of my friends
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/snap_da_real_fotography/">B. Raj</a> is a photographer and he takes awesome photos.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 14, 2018 to Oct 17, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Mornings were spent on doing some random things at home and evening with friends. Other time, I was reading
			The Rust Programming Language (TRPL) book. Also started watching House M.D S-1. I liked House M.D because
			all the episodes were independent of each other. So, it is not addictive.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 13, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Played cricket in morning inside hostel. Most of the people were gone. I deleted PUBG as I found it very addictive to me.
			Raj Tilak and I started in the evening. Dropped Raj Tilak at his home and I went back to my home. On the way back, at a place, stream of water was flowing on the
			road. It was difficult and dangerous driving through that, but anyhow I reached home.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 11, 2018 and Oct 12, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Classes were cancelled due to cyclone Titli. I finally downloaded that addictive game PUBG and immediately got hooked.
			These two days were spent either playing PUBG or FIFA. Heavy rains during the nights due to cyclone Titli.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 10, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Tomorrow's classes were cancelled due to cyclone Titli, so some people left for their homes. "Going home from hostel" mood is
			a very unproductive mood. You don't feel like doing anything. We organised a small FIFA18 tournament in out room. It was
			raining outside due to cyclone Titli.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 8, 2018 and Oct 9, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Back to college for the final week before Durga Puja vacations. Same boring classes. Sigh.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 7, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Spent time recovering from the frustration of OpenEBS. Caught up with <a href="https://vedularaghu.github.io/">Raghu</a> in the evening.
		</p>
		<h3>Oct 1, 2018 to Oct 6, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Web Development session for the freshers.
			Spent time learning Golang as I wanted to write unit tests for OpenEBS project. I thought I can do it but,
			the issue was to write unit tests for HTTP client. I wanted to contribute to OpenEBS because it was giving
			out custom swag. I could have taken some linting issues which would have been damn easy to create and merge PR.
			But, I wanted to make some non-trivial code contribution. I was not able to understand their project.
			I finally gave up on Saturday highly frustrated.
			Lesson learnt : "Don't just contribute for the sake of contributing. Spend time on the projects that you really like."
			Went home in the evening of 6th.
