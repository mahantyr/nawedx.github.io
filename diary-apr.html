	<h3>Apr 25, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Today's test was Discrete Mathematics. Questions were good and they were workable even though you don't have specific knowledge.
		Next test is DAA which I like but didn't take seriously during the midsem and hence messed up. I will make up for it this time.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 24, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Looked for any other opportunity like GSOC. There is EVoC(Xorg) and RSoC(Redox). I want to contribute to Xorg because I want to know how the linux graphics stack works
		and how the drivers are implemented. I also found the Redox projects interesting. Building OS using Rust sounds very interesting. I think I will try Redox first and then I will try Xorg.
		Prepared for Discrete Maths test. Did a quick revision of Graph Theory and learnt about solving recurrence relations and introduction to abstract algebra.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 23, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Today's test was Digital Electronics Circuit. I like this subject and enjoyed the test. A few theoretical questions were unexpected and I messed up there.
		Result of GSOC was announced. I didn't make it and it made me sad. I should have focused on one organization and should have switched to other when I found Libreoffice difficult.
		Spent too much time on Libreoffice and didn't make any contribution either. It hurts when I look back. Anyway, I will make up for it.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 20, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Today's test was System programming. It is very theoretical and we learn about IBM 360 machine. Somehow managed to sail through it. I didn't enjoy the course much.
		Nothing fascinating or I just didn't take much interest. Only thing I liked about the course was the presentation on different optimization algorithms. Though they were
		not part of the course but, I really enjoyed working on it.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 16, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Prepared for the presentation of DEC project. Could not implement the circuit on breadboard as the circuit had a lot of connections and it became complex. But,
		out Proteus simulation was working and our detailed knowledge about the working of each component of the ciruit made us sail through.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 15, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Attended DDM IT Quiz at Pal Heights. It was an awesome quiz session. Later went for lunch. It was the first unofficial outing of Quizzerati (Quizing club of IIIT-Bh).
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 14, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		In the evening attended party of Advaita tech coordinators. Music, Dance and Food. I am not a party guy but that day I sure did a lot of dance and enjoyed (without alcohol).
		Alcohol is just overrated.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 11, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Read a few articles on computer graphics and distributed systems. Built and simulated my electronics project on Proteus.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 10, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Didn't do much technical. Went out for city ride in the evening and had some Lasagna.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 9, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Brought a few UI changes to my website and made it more mobile friendly. Wrote a few basic programs in Go and read a few articles on Distributed systems.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 8, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Spent some quality time with family and caught up with friends in the evening. Reviewed my goals and set goals for the upcoming week.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 7, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Did our presentation on two algorithms and got appreciated for it. Always a great experience working with Ankur and Rahul as we get things done efficiently.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 6, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Prepared for presentation on Harmony Search algorithm and League Championship Algorithm with my teammates Ankur Kumar and Rahul Mahanty (Team - Flappy Birds).
		Had to learn a lot of syntax to prepare presentation for both topics using Beamer. Latex has difficult learning curve but it was a very satisfying experience.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 5, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Started learning about concurrent systems and difference between concurrent and parallel systems. Learnt about netflix microservice architecture.
		I was fascinated by it. Viewed a presentation on Youtube about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso">Concurrency is not Parallelism</a> by Rob Pike (Creator of Go language).
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 4, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Implemented some basic digital electronics circuit in VHDL. Had lab tests of Digital Electronics Lab and Design and Analysis of Algorithm Lab.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 3, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Learnt about bit masking and tried to implement TSP in C++. Then, I got some idea from an answer from stack overflow and then implemented TSP in C++ using dynamic approach.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 2, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Had a late night brainstorming session on building decentralized internet with Himansu.
		Started learning about Travelling Salesman Problem and understood the implementation of brute force, recursive and dynamic approach.
	</p>
	<h3>Apr 1, 2018</h3>
	<p>
		Did some janitor work on freight automation project and finally made the project public. Some more work to do on this project.
		This project has come up pretty well.
