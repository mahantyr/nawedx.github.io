		<h3>August 29, 2018 and August 30, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Class and procrastination.
		<p>
		<h3>August 28, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Attempted the online coding round of Two Sigma.
		<p>
		<h3>August 25, 2018 to August 27, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Attended cousin's wedding.
		<p>
		<h3>August 24, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Started reading "Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment". It starts with chapters on file system and I/O.
			Started implementing the programs given in the book. Also started reading the hacker dictionary (Jargon File) by ESR.
		<p>
		<h3>August 23, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			One of the most productive days. Didn't attend the 2nd half classes and spent time learning more
			about file system. Coded some basic file system features.
			Somehow I landed on Eric S. Raymond's homepage and was reading through his website.
			There he has written about How to become a Hacker? That piece was awesome. I think the book
			"Art of UNIX Programming" brought me to ESR's homepage.
		<p>
		<h3>August 21, 2018 and August 22, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Attended classes and went home in the evening. Aug 22, 2018 was Eid-ul-Adha.
			Spent time with family, relatives and friends.
		<p>
		<h3>August 20, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Read a few articles and posts on hypervisor and how to build one.
			Learnt about the internals of fork() and dup().
		<p>
		<h3>August 18, 2018 and August 19, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			The time spent during these two days is unaccountable. Didn't do much work.
		<p>
		<h3>August 17, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Nation mourns the death of former PM Bajpayi Ji, so holiday was given.
			Watched Comicstaan's finale.
		<p>
		<h3>August 16, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Whole day lab and classes. They suck. In the evening, attended quiz session.
		<p>
		<h3>August 15, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Spent some time interacting with the core members of Tech Society. Independence day holiday.
			Played basketball after a long long time, maybe 10 months.
		<p>
		<h3>August 14, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Read some more about implementation of file system and got an overview of Fast File System (FFS).
		<p>
		<h3>August 11, 2018 to August 13, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Got the in-depth understanding of how files are created, read and written. By running the
			strace command with different system calls I was able to see how system calls are executed.
			Got to understand the atomic nature of renaming a file and why rename is atomic by design.
			I think, I was able to scratch some of the concepts of file system design.
		<h3>August 10, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Caught up with the discussion of p-society. Played FIFA with roomie. Actually played a lot.
		</p>
		<h3>August 9, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Didn't do much work today, just some society work.
		</p>
		<h3>August 8, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Read more about file system implementation from OS Book of Remzi. I need more clarity on the file system design.
			I don't know when can I start writing a file system from scratch.
			Then, I want to use FUSE to implement a file system with some new features.
			I also have a device driver project idea.
			I want to convert an internal DVD-RW to external DVD-RW that can be connected and used through USB.
			These both seem like a daunting task. I will try to do both of these in this semester.
		</p>
		<h3>August 7, 2018</h3>
		<p>
			Read about Ceph file system. Some more progress on Byzantine Generals paper.
		</p>

			I started reading this book by Richard Feynman, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Surely-youre-Joking-Feynman-Adventures/dp/009917331X">"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</a>.
			<p>
				I am using the following two sources for reading about file system design :
				<ul>
					<li>Practical Filesystem Design by Dominic Giampaolo. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjFps2DlNXcAhWLvY8KHXfeCTkQFjAAegQICRAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nobius.org%2Fdbg%2Fpractical-file-system-design.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3tBNgX9ExKjZyPwprHNLeJ"> Link </a></li>
